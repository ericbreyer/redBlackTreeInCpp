# Red Black Tree in C++ From the Ground Up
## Motivation
In my algorithms class at Rice University (COMP 382) we learned about a lot of trees. Red Black trees seemed like black magic and are also very cool so I wanted to get a better understanding for how they work.
As for using C++, I have used C a lot and have a lot of exposure to C++, but I have never really done a proper project. I ended up really liking the language, it gives a lot of OOP niceness like in C# and Java while also giving you the raw power (like pointers) you get from being so close to the machine like in C.

-Rant warning- <br>
I almost feel like writing in different languages is like driving different types of cars. C is like an F1 car: pure raw power and speed but easy to mess up. C++ is more like a sports car: you still feel close to the road but have a few more features. I would equate C# to a Volkwagen Golf GTI, still decently fast and connected but a little higer level features. Python is more like a self driving car, you don't really have to do much. I seem to like the connection to the computer, though I do like some of the higher level features here and there, especially for prototyping.

## Cool features
All in all this is mostly
